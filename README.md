This repository contains the code used within the scope of the ExPoSE Project (<a href = "https://www.exposeproject.net">www.exposeproject.net</a>) to import and harmonise microdata on cardiovascular risk factors and other information from a set of population surveys conducted in South Africa and in England between 1997 and 2017.
</p>
<p style = 'margin:12px; text-align: justify;'> 
The harmonisation code for the England datasets (partly in Stata<superscript>TM</superscript> and partly in SPSS<superscript>TM</superscript>format) is included in the folder EXTRACT_EN. 
The main files are EXTRACT_EN_1.SPS and EXTRACT_EN._2.do, which must be run in sequence and include instructions on how to set-up the directory structure for the input data. The subfolders TEMP and OUT are initially empty and are used by the code to store intermediate and final results, respectively.

The harmonisation code for the South African datasets (in Stata<superscript>TM</superscript> format) is included in the folder EXTRACT_SA. 
The main file is EXTRACT_SA.do, which includes instructions on how to set-up the directory structure for the input data. The subfolder AUXILIARY includes 
geographic and demographic information needed to complete the process. The subfolders TEMP and OUT are initially empty and are used by the code to store intermediate and final results, respectively.
